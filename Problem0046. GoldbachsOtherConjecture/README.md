# Goldbach's Other Conjecture
Problem 46
### Description:
It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

9 = 7 + 2 x 1<sup>2</sup>  
15 = 7 + 2 x 2<sup>2</sup>  
21 = 3 + 2 x 3<sup>2</sup>  
25 = 7 + 2 x 3<sup>2</sup>  
27 = 19 + 2 x 2<sup>2</sup>  
33 = 31 + 2 x 1<sup>2</sup>  

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
