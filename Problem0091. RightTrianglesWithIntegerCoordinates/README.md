# Right Triangles with Integer Coordinates
Problem 91
### Description:
The points P(x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>)
 and Q(x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>)
 are plotted at integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0)
, to form Î” OPQ
.

There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0
 and 2
 inclusive; that is, 0 <= x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub> <= 2
.

Given that 0 <= x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub> <= 50
, how many right triangles can be formed?

### Answer:
```
14234
```
