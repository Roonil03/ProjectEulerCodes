# Problem √13
Problem Root-13
### Description:
The decimal expansion of the square root of two is  
 $$1.\underline{4142135623}730...$$
 

If we define S(n,d)
 to be the the sum of the first d
 digits in the fractional part of the decimal expansion of √n
, it can be seen that S(2, 10) = 4 + 1 + 4 + ... + 3 = 31
.

It can be confirmed that S(2, 100) = 481
.

Find S(13, 1000)
.

Note: Instead of just using arbitrary precision floats, try to be creative with your method.
