# Reversible Numbers
Problem 145
### Description:
Some positive integers $n$ have the property that the sum $(n + \text{reverse}(n))$ consists entirely of odd (decimal) digits. For instance, $36 + 63 = 99$ and $409 + 904 = 1313$. We will call such numbers reversible; so $36, 63, 409,$ and $904$ are reversible. Leading zeroes are not allowed in either $n$ or $\text{reverse}(n)$.

There are $120$ reversible numbers below one-thousand.

How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion ($10^9$)?
