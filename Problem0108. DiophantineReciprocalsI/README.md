# Diophantine Reciprocals I
Problem 108
### Description:
<p>In the following equation $x$, $y$, and $n$ are positive integers.</p>
$$\dfrac{1}{x} + \dfrac{1}{y} = \dfrac{1}{n}$$
<p>For $n = 4$ there are exactly three distinct solutions:</p>
$$\begin{align}
\dfrac{1}{5} + \dfrac{1}{20} &amp;= \dfrac{1}{4}\\
\dfrac{1}{6} + \dfrac{1}{12} &amp;= \dfrac{1}{4}\\
\dfrac{1}{8} + \dfrac{1}{8} &amp;= \dfrac{1}{4}
\end{align}
$$

<p>What is the least value of $n$ for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds one-thousand?</p>
